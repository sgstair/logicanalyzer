FPGA-Based Logic Analyzer-ish device

I have high ambitions for this project, but there's not much to see yet. This repository will grow to eventually contain the hardware, firmware, and software design for a logic analyzer board I'm designing.

If you're interested in working on the core of this project, and you know quite a bit about FPGAs or USB, I'll be happy to talk to you.
Once the core part is working, I'll be more interested in enabling other people to build on it.
More to come as it gets done...
